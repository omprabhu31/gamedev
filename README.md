# Hey there!

Welcome to my gamedev page. Since I'm currently stuck at home due to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (and hella bored), I definitely have a lot of time to play video games. However, I figured why not try out making games instead of just playing them?

You can find links to some of the courses I'm taking/have taken (along with my notes) here: [Gamedev Courses](/gamedev/courses/)

If you wish, you may go through my projects here (links to source files can also be found): [Gamedev Projects](/gamedev/projects/)
