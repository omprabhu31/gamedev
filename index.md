Welcome to the gamedev section of my website. I'm a passionate gamer with a love for programming and 2D pixel art games. Let me walk you through my journey into game development. It all started during the Covid-19 pandemic which had us all locked in our homes. I was already into gaming and spent hours on end playing amazing games like <i>Horizon Zero Dawn</i> and <i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i>. 

I remember thinking to myself how incredible it would be making such interactive media. Initially, I thought it was would be a very specialized job and that it would be insanely difficult to develop games. However, to my surprise, I found it quite the contrary - there is a plethora of online resources and walkthroughs available for aspiring developers, both free and paid. I searched a bit and found that Unity was one of the easiest game engines to get started with, and here I am now!

You can find links to some of the courses I've taken (along with some notes) here: [Game Dev Courses](/gamedev/courses/)

Here is a compilation of all my projects so far (links to some of the files are also included): [Game Dev Projects](/gamedev/projects/)

Quite recently, I've also started creating 2D pixel art & animation. Have a look at some of my creations here (don't expect too much, I'm still a beginner :D): [Art & Animation](/gamedev/art/)

Finally, here is [my gamedev resume](https://omprabhu31.github.io/gamedev/gamedev_resume.pdf) highlighting some important stages in my journey as a game developer. Apart from this website, you can use it as a quick reference to check out some of my skills and experience as a developer. I will be updating it regularly as and when I complete certain courses and finish major projects.

That's it for now! I hope you have fun browsing through the gamedev section (as well as the others, if you'd like). Feel free to contact me any time and/or leave any feedback/criticism using the details on the [contact page](https://omprabhu31.github.io/contact/) or the anonymous message form in the page footer. I hope to hear from you soon!
