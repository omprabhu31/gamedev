Hey there! You probably know by now that I am an aspiring game developer and Unity programmer. I recently also started exploring the field of art and animation, and my love for indie games like <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Stardew Valley</i> naturally led me to pursue pixel art. Aside from free online tutorials, I have also taken a few certified courses in 2D pixel art from Udemy, which you can check out at the bottom of this page. 

I initially started with Piskel as a free tool for pixel art creations and soon switched to Aseprite. I don't have a lot of experience with creating tilesets yet but I use Pyxel Edit for tilesetting. 

You can check out my artwork [here](https://github.com/omprabhu31/gamedev/blob/master/art/). Since I've only started recently, there might not be a lot now. However, I will make sure to regularly the repository with my latest creations. Have fun!

**Note:** Some of the creations were made during courses as practice work, and hence cannot be considered as original. Most of them, though, are my own creations.
