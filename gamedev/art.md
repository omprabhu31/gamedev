Hey there! You probably know by now that I am an aspiring game developer and Unity programmer. I recently also started exploring the field of art and animation, and my love for indie games like <i>Undertale</i> and <i>Stardew Valley</i> naturally led me to pursue pixel art. Aside from free online tutorials, I have also taken a few certified courses in 2D pixel art from Udemy, which you can check out at the bottom of this page. 

I initially started with Piskel as a free tool for pixel art creations and soon switched to Aseprite. I don't have a lot of experience with creating tilesets yet but I use Pyxel Edit for tilesetting. 

Below are some of my pieces of artwork. Since I've only started recently, there might not be a lot now. However, I will make sure to regularly update this page with my latest creations. You can freely use any of these images and their source files if you like - I would prefer that you give me credit, but I leave that to your choice.

**Note:** I will be adding in previews of some of my creations on this webpage shortly. Till then, feel free to browse the [art section of my github repository](https://github.com/omprabhu31/gamedev/blob/master/art/) to view or download any of my creations. Have fun!
