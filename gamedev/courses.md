Hi, I have been working with Unity for well over a year now and have over 300 hours of editor experience. It most likely wouldn't have been possible without the amazing resources I had access to. Aside from free walkthroughs and tutorials on the internet, I have also completed some certified courses on various platforms like Unity Learn, Coursera and Udemy. You can look through them on this page.

I've been maintaining some notes over the course of the courses (sorry, I couldn't resist), which is mainly to provide myself with a better understanding of the coursework. As I progress in each course, I will do my best to upload and update them from time to time.

Finally, you can check out some of my projects and prototypes [here](/gamedev/projects) along with some of the project files. Alternatively, you could just look through my [Unity Play](https://play.unity.com/u/nyx318) page to access the games directly. Happy browsing!
