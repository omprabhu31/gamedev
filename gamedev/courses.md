I am currently undertaking the Junior Programmer pathway on Unity Learn. I've been maintaining some notes over the course of the courses (sorry, I couldn't resist), which is mainly to provide myself with a better understanding of the coursework. As I progress in each course, I will make sure to upload and update it from time to time.

Finally, you can also check some of my projects [here](/gamedev/projects) along with all the Unity project files.
