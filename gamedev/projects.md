Here is where you can find some of my Unity projects along with their respective project files. Feel free to check them out as well as have a little fun with the games. Alternatively you could check out [my Unity Play page](https://play.unity.com/u/om-prabhu) to access all the games directly.

Note that most web browsers do not support WebGL content (try using Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge). If you encounter any bugs and/or have any suggestions or feedback, please contact me [here](https://forms.gle/za5hyQ4nHnz6FT7R6) and I will make sure to fix them at the earliest.

**Note:** I will no longer be providing the source files for a lot of the projects, since the folders are simply too big to upload to GitHub.

> <h3>Arcade-Style Sumo Battle Prototype</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.13f1</i>
>
> This was my fourth project as part of the [Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) on Unity Learn. It focusses on programming gameplay mechanics, such as enemy behaviour, powerups and enemy waves, which is one of the most integral part of game design. It also introduces the concept of Coroutines, which enable the powerups to only act temporarily.
> 
> You play as a cute little sphere on a mystic floating island in the clouds, struggling to fend off the hostile enemies hell-bent on throwing you off. The enemy waves only get tougher, with enemy bosses spawning occasionally. Your goal is to survive as long as possible. This is one of my favourite projects and I had a blast working on it. I hope you will enjoy playing it equally.

> <h3>Run n' Jump Prototype</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.12f1</i>
>
> This was my third project as part of the [Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) on Unity Learn. A lot of the previous projects had well-defined gameplay but no pizzazz. This project introduces the ability to add animations, sound and particle effects to the player character, making it feel a lot more playable. It also focuses on manipulating animations and particle systems using code. A lot of the gameplay aspects such as the super speed and double jump abilities would not be possible if not for scripting.

> <h3>Prototype 2</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This was my second project as part of the [Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) on Unity Learn. It focuses on a lot of integral aspects of basic gameplay including random value generation for instantiating game objects, collision detection to destroy objects, keeping track of player lives and score, etc using code.

> <h3>Car Simulator Prototype</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This was my first project as part of the [Junior Programmer pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/junior-programmer) on Unity Learn. A major focus of this project and a lot of the upcoming ones is the use of scripts to enable various forms of player control in a game (such as switching between camera views, allowing user input to move vehicles, local multiplayer, etc). These are indeed the very fundamentals of programming - a lot more can be achieved with scripts, as you will see!
>
> If you dig into the project files, you can also find a small airplane simulator which was made as a little challenge provided in the pathway. This level is not accessible in the playable WebGL build.

> <h3>2D Platformer Microgame</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This 2D platformer minigame was a little experiment I tried out on one of the default Unity microgames. Unlike a lot of the games previously seen, this is a side-scroller like most 2D platformers. It explores various features of 2D design such as the 2D tile palette, configuring a death zone for the player, configuring power-ups like speed boosts and bounce pads, etc.
>
> P.S: If you really dig deep into the game, you can probably find some very interesting easter eggs of sorts!

> <h3>2D Sprite Pachinko</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This was my third and final project as part of the [Unity Essentials pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) on Unity Learn. Here, we take a little break from 3D design and make a very basic 2D game where an object collides with pins on the screen, bouncing off and eventually falling down. It explores the use of colliders and 2D physics to generate the bounce effect that you can see.

> <h3>House Tour Project</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This was my second project as part of the [Unity Essentials pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) on Unity Learn. This project focuses a little more on programming in C# and how scripts can be used to modify game objects (in this case, we make a car move past the kitchen window). Further, it also explores the basics of real-time audio and its components, such as 3D spatial sound and the Doppler effect.

> <h3>LEGO Microgame</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2020.3.11f1</i>
>
> This was my first project as part of the [Unity Essentials pathway](https://learn.unity.com/pathway/unity-essentials) on Unity Learn. It touches upon the basics of level design and a little bit of programming to add certain animations and other effects to the fold. Aside from completing the in-editor tutorials, I have also used certain microgame mods to change the setting of the game, add custom models and enemies, congifure custom triggers, etc.

> <h3>Box Shooter</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 5.6.7f1</i>
>
> This was my final project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course - this is where earlier design concepts along with basic programming come together to produce a simple first person shooter. The goal is to reach the target score before time runs out.

> <h3>Roller Madness</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2017.4.40f1</i>
>
> This was my second project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course - this is where many theory concepts actually come into action while building out a simple but fully functional game. The goal is to collect as many coins as possible while avoiding enemies or the death zone.

> <h3>Solar System Simulation</h3>
> <i>Made using Unity 2019.4.2f1</i>
>
> This is a simple solar system simulation - my first project as part of the [Introduction to Game Development](https://www.coursera.org/learn/game-development?specialization=game-development) course. Technically it's not a game, but it introduces many important Unity concepts. It ain't much, but it's honest work!
